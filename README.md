# canteen management system

A new Flutter project.

In current situation, the canteens in schools/colleges works in a way that one should pay for the food and should wait for the food to be delivered, but in case of same time slot for students of various classes or departments, it will cause a rush and many other problems. Workload is also increased for the canteen staff and due to limited time some student may not get time to eat and they will waste their food.
The Canteen Management System is useful in the these situations, where it helps in managing the whole process and thereby providing many advantages. The students can order their food via their phones from the canteen management application where he/she needs to login the application for ordering food through e-menu.
